when you try to run the different routes, even though its compiling its not showing the elelments i dont know why 
yess the error is fixed there was a spelling error
esp7+ and some intellisense for npm and and some other extentions need to be downloaded

now i will learn how to fetch from api the yt data and render on my screen
i subscribed to the basic plan. thank god they didnt ask any credit card information
im soo damn happy that they didnt ask any credit card info
now create fetchfromapi.js in utils after copying the code for node js in the api

call the fetch api using the useeffect available so that you can reload as soon as the data loads look in to the function

useeffect is a lifecycle hook that gets loaded when the component initially loads like a constructor

you use Link component of reac router dom to navigate to the vid details from the json of the api so that you can play the vid
