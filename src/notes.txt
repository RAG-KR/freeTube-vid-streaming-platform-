i think at the time stamp 22:20
when you try to run the different routes, even though its compiling its not showing the elelments i dont know why 
yess the error is fixed there was a spelling error
esp7+ and some intellisense for npm and and some other extentions need to be downloaded

now i will learn how to fetch from api the yt data and render on my screen
i subscribed to the basic plan. thank god they didnt ask any credit card information
im soo damn happy that they didnt ask any credit card info
now create fetchfromapi.js in utils after copying the code for node js in the api

call the fetch api using the useeffect available so that you can reload as soon as the data loads look in to the function

useeffect is a lifecycle hook that gets loaded when the component initially loads like a constructor

you use Link component of reac router dom to navigate to the vid details from the json of the api so that you can play the vid

if i console.log(video elelments) in videoCard.jsx ,  it returns an objkect having many things like vid id type etc etc

to test diff spacing ,  i changed Videos.jsx videoCard.jsx and feed.jsx using chat gpt , revert to the old self written versions of that code

// this below code is to fix the channel card not rendering at the timestamp 1:25:25. the error is caused because of using the {} braces instead of () when in rafce ,  i remove the return , it is atleast nesessary to change the brackets which i did not do let me test this thoery

// yess that was exaclty the isSecureContext. the below code from chat gpt indented the flexbox little better and solved this issue but i will stick to the original code and keep doing the rest of the things adding functionality. good learning exp
